# Standard Notes Yaru Theme

Yaru is the default theme for Ubuntu. This is an unofficial Yaru theme for Standard Notes.
This theme is based off my [Overcast Theme](https://github.com/ceiphr/sn-overcast-theme) and the color scheme was inspired by the [Ubuntu Yaru theme suite](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru).

Note: This repo only contains a dark theme. If I recieve requests for a light variant, I will make one.

## Installation

1. Open the [Standard Notes web app](https://app.standardnotes.org/).

2. In extensions, click import, paste `https://changelog.ceiphr.com/p/zwtjsCx2fY` and hit `ENTER`.

3. Click "Install," then activate the *Yaru* theme.
